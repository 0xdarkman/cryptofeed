# FAQ and Oddities

* Why does Poloniex not support trading pairs / Why does the demo have trading pairs in the channels on Poloniex?
  - Poloniex supports a ticker channel that gives you information for ALL trading pairs, or you can subscribe to a trading pair to get updates for that trading pair (book and trades). It doesn't allow you to specify channels and pairs like most the other exchange APIs.
